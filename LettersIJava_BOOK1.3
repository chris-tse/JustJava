1.3 Letters

In Java there are many ways to store a letter or a sequence of letter, known as string. Today we will talk about two types of ways to store a letter or a sequence of letter.

In java, you can use char type or String type, notice that the S is upper case letter.
To declare a String type variable, we use format
String name = “ content” ;

You can also use char type to store letter, but it has to be single character, for example, to declare a char type variable, we use format
char ch = ‘character’; 

Here is an example to declare  String type variables and char types variables and print them out to the console.

public class StringAndChar{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		String str = “Hello World”;
		String myStr=”This is a string”;

		char ch= ‘a’;
		char ch2=’X’;

		System.out.println(str);
		System.out.println(myStr);
		System.out.println(ch);
		System.out.println(ch2);

}
}
