A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages

The /code for  code/ statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. Programmers often refer to it as the "for loop" because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied. The general form of the for statement can be expressed as follows:

/code for (initialization; termination;
     increment) {
    statement(s)
}
code/

When using this version of the for statement, keep in mind that:

1:The initialization expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.
2:When the termination expression evaluates to false, the loop terminates.
3:The increment expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment or decrement a value.

The following program, ForDemo, uses the general form of the for statement to print the numbers 1 through 10 to standard output:


/code
class ForDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
         for(int i=1; i<11; i++){
              System.out.println("Count is: " + i);
         }
    }
}

code/


The output of this program is:
/code
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
Count is: 6
Count is: 7
Count is: 8
Count is: 9
Count is: 10
/code
