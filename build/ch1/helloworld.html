		<p>As with learning any programming language, we'll start off with a "Hello World" program so you can see what a program written in Java might look like. </p>

		<pre data-src="HelloWorld.java"></pre>

		<p>Running that bit of code will print out the following:</p>

		<pre class="language-java"><code class="language-java">Hello World!</code></pre>

		<p>There is quite a lot involved here, but we will only focus on these two lines for now:</p>

		<pre class="language-java"><code class="language-java">public static void main (String[] args) {}</code></pre>

		<p>This is called the main method, and it is usually run first when the program starts. And inside this, we have the actual code which we want to run:</p>

		<pre class="language-java"><code class="language-java">System.out.println("Hello World!");</code></pre>

		<p>Without going into too much detail, <code class="language-java">System.out.println()</code> is a method which prints out whatever is inside the parentheses and also outputs a newline.</p>

		<p>If we get into detail, this will get complicated very quickly, but for now, practice programs can be written by copying the example below and changing the code within the main method, changing "HelloWorld" on the first line to the same as your filename.</p>

		<p>In the next few lessons, we'll cover some of the data types used in Java.</p>
